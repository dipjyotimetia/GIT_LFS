# GIT_LFS

Git LFS is a system for managing and versioning large files in                                          
association with a Git repository.  Instead of storing the large files                                  
within the Git repository as blobs, Git LFS stores special "pointer                                     
files" in the repository, while storing the actual file contents on a                                   
Git LFS server.  The contents of the large file are downloaded                                          
automatically when needed, for example when a Git branch containing                                     
the large file is checked out.                                                                          
                                                                                                        
Git LFS works by using a "smudge" filter to look up the large file                                      
contents based on the pointer file, and a "clean" filter to create a                                    
new version of the pointer file when the large file's contents change.                                  
It also uses a pre-push hook to upload the large file contents to                                       
the Git LFS server whenever a commit containing a new large file                                        
version is about to be pushed to the corresponding Git server.                                          
                                                                                                        
Examples                                                                                                
--------                                                                                                
                                                                                                        
To get started with Git LFS, the following commands can be used.                                        
                                                                                                        
 1. Setup Git LFS on your system. You only have to do this once per                                     
    repository per machine:                                                                             
                                                                                                        
        git lfs install                                                                                 
                                                                                                        
 2. Choose the type of files you want to track, for examples all ISO                                    
    images, with git lfs track:                                                                         
                                                                                                        
        git lfs track "*.iso"                                                                           
                                                                                                        
 3. The above stores this information in gitattributes(5) files, so                                     
    that file need to be added to the repository:                                                       
                                                                                                        
        git add .gitattributes                                                                          
                                                                                                        
 3. Commit, push and work with the files normally:                                                      
                                                                                                        
        git add file.iso                                                                                
        git commit -m "Add disk image"                                                                  
        git push                                                                                        
                   
Commands                                                                                                
--------                                                                                                
                                                                                                        
Like Git, Git LFS commands are separated into high level ("porcelain")                                  
commands and low level ("plumbing") commands.                                                           
                                                                                                        
High level commands
